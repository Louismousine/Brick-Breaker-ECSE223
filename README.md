Winner of best Brick Breaker app as part of the ECSE 223: Model-Based Programming (Winter 2019) class!

## General Information

Like all brick breaker games, the goal is to destroy all of the bricks by using the paddle to deflect the ball towards the bricks. When a brick is hit, points are awarded to the player and the ball speeds up. Upon losing all of their lives or completing the final level, the player will be presented a hall of fame where they can see how they stacked up against previous players.
In this brick breaker installment, users can also choose to design levels for other users to play. Game administrators may edit the game settings (length of paddle, ball speed, etc.) and create and place bricks at the position of their choosing.

What distinguishes our applet from our peers' brick breaker apps are the remarquably user-friendly interface, the aesthetic look of the program, as well as the added sound effects. Try it for yourself!

## Getting Started

The project instructions required the app data to be saved in a text file within the project folder. Because it is impossible for JARs to write to/read a file, the applet is only fully functional when running through the command line or any IDE.
